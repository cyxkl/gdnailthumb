    <h1>Welcome to GDThumb</h1>
    <h3 class="question">What is this website about?</h3>
    <h3 class="question">This is basically a site where I (Cyen) upload most of my Geomtry Dash Demon thumbnails that I have specifically made for free-to-use purposes. This site also doubles as an art portfolio for my work so yeah. I will also be updating this site frequently with new thumbnails (and maybe a bit of features/functionalities), so keep that in mind.</h3>
    <p class="xtraInfo">You can go to the gallery to view and download all of the thumbnails I've made. All of my contacts will be stored in the Contacts page. The updates page is like a tracker, to help keep track of what I have done with the website itself on specific days. Feel free to go through this website :)</p>
