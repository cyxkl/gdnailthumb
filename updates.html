    <h1><u>Updates</u></h1>
    <p class="update">07/07/21 - Well damn, it's been quite some time since I have updated this site (life is good) so yeah, added 2 new thumbnails. One of which being a normal extreme demon thumbnail, and the other belonging to an insane demon. Might not update this site for a couple months due to time constraints and the fact that I no longer have my personal laptop (since I sold it), but instead an extremely slow family pc. This is it for this update I guess.</p>
    <p class="update">05/14/21 - Well it's been a while since I have updated this site, so as making thumbnails in general. In return for the lack of updates, I just added thumbnails for Niflheim and Virtual Collapse. I have plans for other features, such as a feature to look up certain thumbnails, so watch out for that. I'm also going to work on thumbnails for hard and insane demons since yeah, haven't got to those in quite a while also.</p>
    <p class="update">04/23/21 - Hey look, it's release day. Ok for reals, nothing much happened. I just made an update to the home page where there's a button that directly leads you to the gallery (inspiration from pointercrate). Also added underlines to most of the "upper text" (as you can see from the Update title) since I thought it'd look cool.</p>
    <p class="update">04/22/21 - Quite a huge update for this day. I've restyled the entire ui to make it more user-friendly since the other one was quite small and "unfitting" for the website's theming.</p>
    <p class="update">for context (old ui)</p>
    <div class="imgCenterer">
        <img src="images/old_ui.png" />
    </div>
    <p class="update">04/21/21 - Holy shit, a lot was done for this day. Thumbnails for Innards, Black Blizzard, and Allegiance have now been added. I've also added a feature where you can now download any image by tapping/clicking on it. Now, recent thumbnails appear first instead of having everything in a skewed order. Oh, I've added things on the Home and Contacts pages so they can also have text inside them.</p>
    <p class="update">04/20/21 - This is where everything started, from the interface all to the gallery itself. Was able to get this site up and running on github pages so yeah.</p>
